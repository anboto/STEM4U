# STEM4U

Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics involve a huge need of computing.

[STEM4U](https://anboto.github.io/srcdoc$STEM4U$STEM4U$en-us.html) includes libraries focused to make life easier for those who want to make a better world through science and technology.

Libraries included are:

- [Polynomial](https://anboto.github.io/src$STEM4U$Polynomial_en-us.html): A templated polynomial type able to handle coefficients of any type including arbitrary precision rational numbers

- [Rational](https://anboto.github.io/src$STEM4U$Rational_en-us.html): An [arbitrary integer precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number) rational number type based on intInf

- [intInf](https://anboto.github.io/src$STEM4U$intInf_en-us.html): An integer type with [arbitrary-precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic) including the usual arithmetic.

- [Combinations](https://anboto.github.io/src$STEM4U$Combinations_en-us.html): Permutations and combinations functions.

- [Finantial](https://anboto.github.io/src$STEM4U$Finantial_en-us.html): Some financial functions.

- [TSP](https://anboto.github.io/src$STEM4U$TSP_TavellingSalesman_en-us.html): A symmetric [Traveling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) (TSP) solver.

- [Butterworth](https://anboto.github.io/src$STEM4U$Butterworth_en-us.html): Butterworth IIR filter following interface similar to Matlab

- [Catenary](https://anboto.github.io/src$STEM4U$Catenary_en-us.html): Simple catenary mooring line solver considering sagging and bottom.

examples/STEM4U_DemoTest allows to demonstrate and test some libraries features.
